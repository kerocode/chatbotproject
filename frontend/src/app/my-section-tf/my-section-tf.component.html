              Follicular lymphoma (FL) is typically a slow-growing or indolent form of non- Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that
              arises from B-lymphocytes, making it a B-cell lymphoma. This lymphoma subtype accounts for 20 to 30
              percent
              of
              all
              NHL cases.

              Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is cancer that affect lymphocytes.
              When most of the cancer cells are located in the bloodstream and the bone marrow, the disease is referred
              to
              as
              CLL.

              Mantle Cell lymphoma is typically an aggressive, rare, form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that arises from
              cells originating in the “mantle zone.” MCL accounts for roughly six percent of all NHL cases in the
              United
              States.

              as you can see, it is very hard to identify the difference between this three type of cancers, or at least
              to
              normal person who have not been studied these type before; moreover, not all doctor can easly know which
              one
              is
              which.
